Axonal and Dendritic Initial orientation and Growth Mechanism
-Objective should be to increase as much sparsity as possible.
-Generate a random orientation generator to assign initial orientation
-Create a growth mechanism for axon which should changes direction if it is not finding any connections and it should also when it has grown above the limit.

Extraction of outputs temporal output / spatial output ?

Also need to account for temporal axons for incoming temporal connection and apical axons from upper layers
