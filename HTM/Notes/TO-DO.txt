Axonal and Dendritic Initial orientation and Growth Mechanism
-Objective should be to increase as much sparsity as possible.
-Generate a random orientation generator to assign initial orientation
-Create a growth mechanism for axon which should changes direction if it is not finding any connections and it should also when it has grown above the limit.

Answer : Axon should be initially just one and then start to segment off after max allowed positions in different directions.

Extraction of outputs temporal output / spatial output ?
we will have input sdr and output sdr defines the state of the whole system i.e all the states of the neuron

Also need to account for temporal axons for incoming temporal connection and apical axons from upper layers.

ANalysis : See if in windows you can move the mouse on the screen via code?
-Create a SDR generator for raw audio and raw video sounds essentially a Encoder which translates the desktop screen pixel values and audio of the clicks into SDR's which can be fed into HTM's.
	-Get integer encoder from Nupic and get it working for my codebase
	-Decide on specificaions for number of pixels to be consumed around the cursor
	-Decide on how to generate cursor location specific to the environment and to be fed in as SDR's
	-Decide on structure of neural schema for generating neural hierarchy of regions.

-Create a Mouse Decoder that translates SDR's generated by HTM regions into mouse cursor movements.(will use nupic integer encoders.)

-Create a launcher thread that can communicate to and launch multiple regions to which it can send these generated patterns and also help in intercommunication between the regions.
