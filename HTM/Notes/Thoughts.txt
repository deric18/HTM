1.Every Neuron tried to express itself as much as possible over the whole network , Every Neuron tends to connect to as many accidental good connections as possible to express itself on the whole network.


Types of Growths:
1.Neuronal Growth : Every neuron as time progress , grows its dendrites adding more connections to its belt , in the process it will keep on finding new possible connections (synaptogenesis) and keep the ones that
survive and remove ones that do not survive. such growth mechanism does not need a specific position of growth they randomly get connected with firing neurons/ biasing axon lines.
2.Connection Update: In this type of growth a particular connection point/synapse that is firing often will grow more and more stronger.


Thought Process for Justification:
-AddNewConnection under Segment should not have position4d parameter becuase then CPM will need to do processing to find out the best position to add to the segment , the segment should figure out which connection
will be better for it.
