--------------------------CONCEPTS AND ETIMOLOGY----------------
REGION - REGION IS COMPOSED OF A LARGE NUMBER OF BLOCKS INTERCONNECTED TO EACH OTHER.
RANDOM BOUND BLOCK - BLOCK WITHIN WHICH A NEW POSITION IS ESTIMATED FOR THE EXISTING SYNAPSE.
BASIS_BLOCK  - THESE ARE THE BLOCKS THAT ARE ON THE EDGE FACES OF THE REGION.
CORE_BLOCKS  - THESE ARE THE BLOCKS THAT ARE CORNERS OF THE ENTIRE REGION , THESE ARE ALSO AT THE EXTRE EDGES OF EDGE BLOCKS OVERLAPPED BETWEEN TWO FACES OF THE REGION.
			  A SQUARE CAN ONLY HAVE 8 BASIS BLOCKS IN IT.
