--------------------------CONCEPTS AND ETIMOLOGY----------------
RANDOM BOUND BLOCK - BLOCK WITHIN WHICH A NEW POSITION IS ESTIMATED FOR THE NEW POSITION.
NEURON BLOCK - EVERY NEURON HAS A BLOCK THAT EXTENDS TO ITS RIGHT AND ABOVE WHERE IT BECOMES THE ORIGIN OF THAT BLOCK ITS ALWAYS ONE UNIT IN DIMENSION.
ORIGIN POINT - EVERY BLOCK HAS AN ORIGIN POINT WHERE THE CONNECTION POINT CLOSES TO THE REGIONS ORIGIN BECOMES THE ORIGIN POINT WHERE ALL THE CONNECTION POINTS BEGIN.
BASIS BLOCK - THESE ARE THE BLOCKS THAT ARE ON THE EDGE FACES OF THE REGION.
