NEURO BLOCK : A Neuroblock is a fundamental building block of a neuro-kernel , 	multiple neuroblock organised in a hierarchy with abilities of routing information back and forth between each other form a NeuroKernel.
Neuroblocks mainly perform one important function i.e SEQUENCE MEMORY. Sequence Memory for those who do not know , given an input , sequence memory outputs all the possibilities associated with this input. for understanding purpose
lets say we feed input as a string : "Tree" to the neuroblock , the block predicts output as {"green", "leaves", "branches", ...etc} , the exact values depend on what data the neuroblock is trained on. 
Neuroblocks also perform another important function that is it can accepts a couple of biasing signals (temporal biasing signal/ Apical biasing signal) and a feedfarward signal and then generate output based on these inputs.

SEQUENCE MEMORY:

CONFIGURABLE NETWORKS : You can configure the number of neurons in the cube.

FLEXIBLE : Killing off few neurons wont hurt the system, unless you remove a sizeable say 40% of the neuronal network.
