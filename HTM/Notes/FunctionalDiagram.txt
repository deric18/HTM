Connection Point Manager :
-Connection Point Management: 
	1.Maintains list of all the connection points present in the system , total dendrite points and total connection points / synapse points.
	2.Supports functionalities like processing spatial input , processing temporal or apical inputs, processing neuronal fires.
-Block Initialization : 
	1.Inititalises and starts up the whole block.
-Handles different work cycles like:
	1.Predict workcycle.
	2.Process workcycle.
-Supports some analysis functions for network analysis.

-Neuron:
	1.Should be able to accept input(spatial,apical /temporal) and update its internal state
	2.Update internal connections after each fire and send grow signals to all segments.

-Segment:
	1.Using a proximity localized random number generator creates connections with neigbhouring neurons.
	2.updates its weights after every process , predict cycle to all its connections.
	3.Creates new sub segments based on growth potential.
	4.Maintains a expoenential potentiation spike to its neuron on simultaneous localised firing of its dendrites and subsegments.


Launcher:
-Workflow management of CPM : 
1.Initialise
2.Process input from SP.
3.Update SP
4.Process output of SP to CPM
5.Update CPM
6.Process TP/AP (if any) on CPM
6.Store output of CPM and Update CPM.
7.Send Output of CPM to Higher Connected Regions.
