																GENERATING A NEW RANDOM POSITION
1.Set Bounds on the original position to form the random neuro block
2.Basis Block Check
	a.Construct an interval for the values the synapse can be formed and return the interval
3.If not a basis block then do a Random Neuro block check if it sits within the existing block or it crosses over.

-Check if the given position belong to any of the basis block
-if so assign respective coordinate to 0 and predict the rest and return.

handling Core Basis Block :
--check x,y,z block radius differences and set it to zero respc.
-evaluate there counterparts to construct the RSB
-Predict the new position with that .


															  CREATING DENDRITIC AND AXONAL SEGMENTS
1. Dendrites close to the chest & Axons up far away to the stars
-Every neuron creates axonal and dendritic proximal segments firzt close to it in its own block and then there by expanding away from it out into the block.

																GROWTH STRATERGY FOR NEURONS
1. Growth index defines how many times the neuron needs to fire before we add a new connection point to the neuron or the segment , once the neuron crosses the fire index the neuron will grow the particular segment 


																		ENCODERS

BYTE ENCODER
Compute()
-Compute the radius
-If radius is odd ! great create the buckets 
-else 
 --rectangular adjustment
 --understand how many buckets need to be created!
 --compute start and end indices both along x & y co-ordinates , create the bucket then run a check to see if there is enough space to create another bucket on the x axis if so continue otherwise set x-index to 0 and increment y-start-index to radius
   repeat the process
