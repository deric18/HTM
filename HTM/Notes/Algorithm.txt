RBR - Random Block Radius
BASIS BLOCK			- THESE ARE THE BLOCKS THAT ARE ON THE EDGE FACES OF THE REGION.
NUMBLOCKSPERCOL		- TOTAL NUMBER OF BLOCK PER ONE ROW OF THE REGION
NUMBLOCKSPERROW		- TOTAL NUMBER OF BLOCKS PER ONE COLUMN OF THE REGION


-Check if the given position belong to any of the basis block
-if so assign respective coordinate to 0 and predict the rest and return.

handling Core Basis Block :
--check x,y,z block radius differences and set it to zero respc.
-evaluate there counterparts to construct the RSB
-PPRedict the new position with that .
