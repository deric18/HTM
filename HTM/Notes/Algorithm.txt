																GENERATING A NEW RANDOM POSITION
1.Set Bounds on the original position to form the random neuro block
2.Basis Block Check
	a.Construct an interval for the values the synapse can be formed and return the interval
3.If not a basis block then do a Random Neuro block check if it sits within the existing block or it crosses over.

-Check if the given position belong to any of the basis block
-if so assign respective coordinate to 0 and predict the rest and return.

handling Core Basis Block :
--check x,y,z block radius differences and set it to zero respc.
-evaluate there counterparts to construct the RSB
-Predict the new position with that .
